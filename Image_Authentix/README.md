# Image Forgery Detection System

**Image Forgery Detection System** uses advanced techniques such as Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify and authenticate digital images. The system detects image tampering and manipulation, helping in the verification of image authenticity for various applications like digital forensics, social media, and legal proceedings.

## Key Features
- **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**: Identifies compression artifacts in images caused by tampering, even when the image has been resaved in lossy formats.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Utilizes deep learning to differentiate between authentic and manipulated images with high accuracy.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI that allows users to upload and analyze images for potential forgery.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Ensure `pip` is upgraded.

### Install Dependencies
To install the required Python modules, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

#EXISTING SYSTEM

In the realm of digital image forgery detection, the utilization of deep learning techniques has become increasingly prevalent. An existing system, which employed the MobileNetV2 architecture, stands as a testament to the efficacy of this approach in addressing the critical challenge of detecting image forgeries. MobileNetV2 is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture that has been specifically designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. Its lightweight design and computational efficiency make it an attractive choice for tasks where resource constraints are a concern. In the context of digital image forgery detection, MobileNetV2 provides a streamlined and effective solution. The existing system, utilizing MobileNetV2, demonstrated impressive results in distinguishing between authentic and tampered images.

#PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed system for image forgery detection is a comprehensive approach that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with Error Level Analysis (ELA) to achieve accurate and robust detection of manipulated images. This system addresses the critical need for reliable forgery detection in the era of digital image manipulation. The proposed system employs a CNN model as its core. The CNN is designed to perform feature extraction and classification of images efficiently. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising both authentic and tampered images. During training, it learns to identify distinctive patterns, features, and inconsistencies that indicate image manipulation. Various hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, filter sizes, and learning rates, are fine-tuned to optimize the model's performance. Appropriate activation function such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), is used to introduce non-linearity in the model.
